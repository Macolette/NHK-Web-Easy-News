Selling Detergents to Customers Who Bring Their Own Containers to Reduce Plastic Waste.

The reduction of plastic waste has become very important.

Two Lawson Convenience Stores located in Tokyo have started an experiment where they sell laundry detergents to customers by refilling their empty containers.

There is also a store located in Minato that sells dishwashing liquid and laundry detergents in large containers.

Customers have also been coming back with their large containers to refill them with detergent. 

An investigation was conducted to understand the costs.

Compared to normal prices, customers are able to save around 20% to 30% more.

In Japan, 47% of plastic wastes are coming from shops that still use plastic shopping bags, bottles and otherã€€plastic containers.

A decrease in people who use plastic bags has been observed due the implementation of fees for people who use them since July.

Other shops could learn from Lawson's example in addressing the decrease in use of plastic containers.
